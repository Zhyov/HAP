# HAP

HAP (formerly known as HMLP) is my best python project to this date. Its name stands for "Help me with my Alphabet Pronunciation." This is a program I intended for my personal use, but I felt like sharing it. Suggestions for new languages, alphabets or optimizations are always welcome. You can create an issue for a new translation/alphabet or create a pull request to add it yourself.

The available languages whose alphabets, syllabaries and/or adbjads are supported by HAP are:
* Spanish (v0.1-.7.1)
* Russian (v0.1-.7.1)
* Greek (v0.1-.7.1)
* Japanese (v0.1-.7.1)
* Hebrew (v0.2-.6.3)
* Toki Pona (v0.5-.6.3)
* Korean (v0.6.0-.3)
* Arab (v0.6.0-.3)
* Armenian (v0.6.1-.3)
* Turkish (v0.6.1-.3)
* Inuktitut (v0.6.1-.3)
* Futhark (v0.6.2-.3)
* Esperanto (v0.6.3)

Previously supported languages will be added in the near future.
