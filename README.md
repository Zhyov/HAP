# HAP

HAP (formerly known as HMLP) is my best python project to this date. Its name stands for "Help me with my Alphabet Pronounciation." This is a program I intended for my personal use, but I felt like sharing it. Suggestions for new languages, alphabets or optimizations are always welcome.

The available alphabets are for the next languages:
* Spanish (v0.1-0.7)
* Russian (v0.1-0.7)
* Greek (v0.1-0.6.3)
* Japanese (v0.1-0.6.3)
* Hebrew (v0.2-0.6.3)
* Toki Pona (v0.5-0.6.3)
* Korean (v0.6.0-.3)
* Arab (v0.6.0-.3)
* Armenian (v0.6.1-.3)
* Turkish (v0.6.1-.3)
* Inuktitut (v0.6.1-.3)
* Futhark (v0.6.2-.3)

Previously supported languages will be added in the near future.
